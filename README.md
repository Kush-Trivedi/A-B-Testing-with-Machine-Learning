<center><h2>A/B Testing with Machine Learning</h2></center>

I was recently reading [Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/) of Business Science's A/B Testing with [Machine Learning - A Step-by-Step Tutorial](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/03/11/ab-testing-machine-learning.html). I've always been intrigued by the concept of <b>A/B testing</b> and the potential influence it may have on businesses. The instruction is quite detailed, and Matt has thoroughly described each and every step. He has written down every choice he made while designing the answer.

Despite the fact that the course is written in <b>R</b>, I was able to scram through his code and comprehend the principles fast because to my experience of Data Science. I owe it to Matt to bring together all of the important parts of the Data Science field and use them to solve problems.

<b>I decided to try to duplicate the approach in Python and was successful. There are a few tiny variations in my implementation, but I believe they can be overlooked. Aside from cell annotations, I haven't gone through any of the processes because you should actually read the post I linked to.</b>
